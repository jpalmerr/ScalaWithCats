**The Problem:** 
Blocking the Event Loop

**Key Concepts:**

1. Event Loop Model

Think of an event loop as a waiter in a restaurant:
- The waiter takes orders (events) from multiple tables (handlers)
- They process each order quickly and move to the next
- If the waiter gets stuck at one table for too long, all other tables suffer

**In Vert.x:**

- Event loops are threads that process events/tasks in a queue
- Each loop handles many different pieces of work in rapid succession
- They're designed for non-blocking operations only

2. Verticles
   
Verticles are like mini-applications or actors:

- Self-contained units of code that get deployed in Vert.x
- Each verticle is assigned to ONE specific event loop thread
- Multiple verticles share the same event loop (like multiple tables per waiter)

3. The Architecture Example Issue

- Vert.x maintains N event loop threads (default: 2 Ã— CPU cores)
- Even with 1000+ verticles deployed, you still have the same ~16-20 event loop threads
- Each verticle is permanently assigned to one event loop

**Why This Matters:**

When you block an event loop thread:

- All verticles on that thread freeze: If you have 50 verticles sharing that event loop, they all stop processing
- Cascading delays: Messages queue up, timeouts occur, the system becomes unresponsive
- Resource waste: You're essentially turning an efficient async system into a slow synchronous one

**Golden Rule:**

Never block the event loop!

Each event loop thread is precious and shared among many verticles. Blocking one affects many components of your application.

Think of it this way: In a restaurant with only 4 waiters serving 100 tables, if one waiter stops to have a 10-minute conversation at one table, 25 other tables can't get any service. That's exactly what happens when you block an event loop thread in Vert.x.

**Fix**

```java
if (fetchingBrokers) {
        log.debug("Skipping broker fetch - previous call still running");
    return;
            }
fetchingBrokers = true;
```

```java
vertx.executeBlocking(() -> {
    return clientService.getKafkaMainNodes();
}, false)
```

```java
.onComplete(ar -> {
fetchingBrokers = false;  // Reset the guard
        if (ar.succeeded()) {
        numberOfBrokers.set(ar.result().size());
        gauge.measure();
    } else {
            log.error("Failed to get Kafka main nodes for metrics", ar.cause());
        }
        });
```

Before: `clientService.getKafkaMainNodes()` was running on the event loop thread (blocking it)
After: This operation runs on a worker thread instead
