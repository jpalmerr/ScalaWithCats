Something I've come across at work is defining the type such as Monoid.

A cool explanation/example from Cats as to why I've seen this.

Explicits over Implicits

Remember that Scala will only use an instance of Foldable
if the method isnâ€™t explicitly available on the receiver. 

For example, the following code will use the version
of foldLeft defined on List:


```scala worksheet
List(1, 2, 3).foldLeft(0)(_ + _)
// Int = 6
```

whereas the following generic code will use Foldable:

```
import scala.language.higherKinds

def sum[F[_]: Foldable](values: F[Int]): Int =
  values.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)

// sum: [F[_]](values: F[Int])(implicit evidence$1: cats. Foldable[F])Int
```
