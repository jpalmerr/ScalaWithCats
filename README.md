# Scala with Cats

Working through the [Scala with Cats book](https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/), written by:

- Noel Welsh
- Dave Gurnell

The goal is to teach system architecture and design
using the techniques of modern functional programming.

This also serves as an introduction to the Cats library.

# Cool stuff I've seen

This repo also contains interesting techniques, definitions, perspectives and other things I've come across, 
either professionally or when researching, and found useful.
